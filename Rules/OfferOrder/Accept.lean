/-- EARS: When a customer accepts an offer, the system shall create an order
only if the offer has not expired and contains at least one item.

Story: As a customer, I want to accept an offer I was shown, so that I get an
order for exactly those services at the offered price.

Acceptance criteria:

* OO-001.1: If a customer accepts an offer at or after its expiry instant,
  then the system shall reject it as expired.
* OO-001.2: If a customer accepts an unexpired offer that has no items, then
  the system shall reject it as empty.
* OO-001.3: If a customer accepts an unexpired offer with an item priced in a
  currency other than the offer's, then the system shall reject it for mixed
  currencies.
* OO-001.4: When a customer accepts an unexpired offer with at least one item
  and every item priced in the offer's currency, the system shall create an
  order.
* OO-001.5: When an order is created from an offer, the system shall price the
  order at the sum of the offer's item prices.

The checks run in order: expiry first, then an empty offer, then items priced
in a currency other than the offer's.  The order's price is the sum of the
item prices, in the offer's currency. -/
