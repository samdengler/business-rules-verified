# Orders

An order is what the customer bought: the items of an accepted offer, each
with its own delivery state.  It corresponds to the IATA ONE Order {lit}`Order`,
{lit}`OrderItem`, and the delivery status of a service.

/-- EARS: When a delivery event is applied to a service, the system shall allow
only the transitions ready to delivered, ready to cancelled, cancelled to
refunded.

Story: As an operations agent, I want a service's delivery state to change only
along the allowed transitions, so that a delivered service is never cancelled
and a service is never refunded before it is cancelled.

Acceptance criteria:

* OO-002.1: When a ready service is delivered, the system shall mark it
  delivered.
* OO-002.2: When a ready service is cancelled, the system shall mark it
  cancelled.
* OO-002.3: When a cancelled service is refunded, the system shall mark it
  refunded.
* OO-002.4: If a delivered service is cancelled, then the system shall refuse
  the event.
* OO-002.5: If any other event is applied to a service, then the system shall
  refuse the event.

The result is the new state, or {lean}`none` when the event is not allowed in the
current state. -/
