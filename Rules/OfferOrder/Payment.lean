/-- EARS: When a refund is requested against a payment, the system shall accept it
only if the refund amount does not exceed that payment's amount.

Story: As a customer service agent, I want each refund checked against the
payment it is made against, so that a customer is never refunded more than
they paid.

Acceptance criteria:

* OO-003.1: When a refund is requested against a payment, the system shall
  accept it only if it names that payment and its amount does not exceed the
  payment's amount.
* OO-003.2: The system shall not refund more against an order than was paid
  for it.

The check looks at this one refund and this one payment; it does not look at
refunds already made against the same payment. -/
