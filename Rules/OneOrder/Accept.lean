# Creating an order from an offer

The ONE Order way: each offer item becomes one order item, and each order item
gets one service per passenger and flight segment, since an ordered service is
for one passenger on one segment.

/-- EARS: When a customer accepts an offer, the system shall create an order with
one order item for each offer item and one service for each passenger and
flight segment of that item.

Story: As an airline, I want each accepted offer item to become one order item
with a service for every passenger and segment, so that each service can be
delivered and accounted for on its own.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-001.1: When an offer is accepted, the system shall create exactly one
  order item for each offer item.
* ONE-001.2: When an order item is created, the system shall give it one
  service for each passenger and flight segment of its offer item.
* ONE-001.3: When an order is created, the system shall give its order items
  distinct references.
* ONE-001.4: When an order is created, the system shall mark it opened.
* ONE-001.5: If a customer accepts an offer at or after its expiry instant, then
  the system shall reject it as expired.

The checks before creating the order are the same as in the airline's rules:
expiry first, then an empty offer, then items priced in another currency. -/
