# Billing and the airline's books

What a service provider may bill the ORA, and how the ORA's accounting treats
the money paid for each service: held as a liability until the service
reaches a final delivery status, then recognized as revenue, refunded or kept.
The sources tie billing and revenue to delivery without saying which final
statuses count, so the model takes the answers as parameters.

/-! ## Billing by service providers -/

/-- A service as its provider bills for it: the service, the provider that
delivers it, and its settlement value, the amount that provider may bill the
ORA, in minor units. -/
structure ProvidedService where
  /-- The service, with its delivery status. -/
  service : Service
  /-- The provider that delivers it, by its code. -/
  provider : String
  /-- The settlement value: what the provider may bill the ORA for it. -/
  settlementValue : Nat
  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- Which delivery statuses count as delivered or consumed for billing.
Resolution 797 says delivered or consumed without naming statuses.  The
settled part: a delivered service counts, and a service that is not yet
delivered or was cancelled does not.  The model takes the answer for the
others, such as NOT CLAIMED and EXPIRED, as a parameter: a reading of the
sources. -/
structure ConsumptionReading where
  /-- Whether a service in a delivery status counts as delivered or consumed. -/
  consumed : DeliveryStatus → Bool
  /-- A delivered service counts. -/
  delivered : consumed .delivered = true
  /-- A service not yet delivered, or cancelled, does not count. -/
  notYet : ∀ s, s = .requested ∨ s = .confirmed ∨ s = .readyToProceed ∨ s = .readyToDeliver ∨
    s = .removed ∨ s = .removedHoldValue → consumed s = false

/-- A bill a service provider sends the ORA for one service. -/
structure Bill where
  /-- The provider that bills, by its code. -/
  provider : String
  /-- The service billed for. -/
  serviceId : String
  /-- The amount billed, in minor units. -/

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- What has been billed for a service so far. -/
def billedFor (bills : List Bill) (serviceId : String) : Nat :=
  ((bills.filter (·.serviceId == serviceId)).map (·.amount)).sum

/-- EARS: If a service provider bills the ORA for a service before it has been
delivered or consumed, then the system shall refuse the bill unless a
bilateral agreement allows earlier billing.

Story: As an airline, I want providers to bill me only for what they have
delivered, so that I never pay a provider for a service the customer did not
receive.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-808.1: If a service provider bills for a service that has not been
  delivered or consumed, then the system shall refuse the bill unless a
  bilateral agreement with that provider allows earlier billing.
* ONE-808.2: If a service provider bills for a service another provider
  delivers, then the system shall refuse the bill.
* ONE-808.3: The system shall keep the total billed for each service within
  its settlement value, and at zero while it has not been delivered or
  consumed unless a bilateral agreement allows earlier billing.
* ONE-808.4: When a provider bills for a delivered service within what is
  left of its settlement value, the system shall accept the bill.

The bills are checked against the services' delivery statuses when they
arrive.  Which statuses count as delivered or consumed is a reading of the
sources ({name}`ConsumptionReading`).  The result says whether the bill is
accepted. -/

/-- What each final delivery status does with the amount paid for a service.
The sources tie revenue to the final delivery status without saying which
final statuses earn it, except that a delivered service does.  The model takes
the answer for the others, and for a penalty reported at cancellation, as a
parameter: a reading of the sources. -/

/-- What accounting does with a cancellation whose refund, penalty and
forfeited amount do not add up to the amount paid for the service.  The
sources send the three amounts to accounting without saying they must add up,
so the model takes the answer as a parameter: a reading of the sources. -/

/-- EARS: The system shall hold the amount paid for a service as a liability
until the service reaches a final delivery status, and only then recognize it
as revenue.

Story: As a revenue accountant, I want revenue recognized only when a service
reaches a final status, and every payment accounted for, so that the books of
each order balance.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-809.1: While a paid service has not reached a final delivery status,
  the system shall hold the amount paid for it as a liability and recognize
  none of it as revenue.
* ONE-809.2: When a paid service is DELIVERED, the system shall recognize the
  amount paid for it as revenue.
* ONE-809.3: When a paid service reaches a final delivery status, the system
  shall hold none of the amount paid for it as a liability.
* ONE-809.4: The system shall keep each order's payments equal to its refunds,
  plus the amount held as liability, plus the revenue recognized, plus the
  forfeited amounts.
* ONE-809.5: The system shall never refund more for an order than was paid
  for it.
* ONE-809.6: Where the airline checks the amounts of a cancellation, the
  system shall refuse a report whose refund, penalty and forfeited amount do
  not add up to the amount paid for the service.

The final statuses are those of ONE-103 ({name}`isFinal`).  Whether a final
status other than DELIVERED earns revenue, refunds the amount paid or keeps it
as a liability, and whether a penalty is recognized at cancellation, are a
reading of the sources ({name}`RevenueReading`).  Payments for a
service in a final status are refused, and a service is cancelled only before
it reaches one.  The sources send payments, refunds, penalties and forfeited
amounts to accounting but state no balance, and do not say whether the
amounts of a cancellation must add up to what was paid; that is a reading too
({name}`CancelCheck`).  The result is the books afterwards, or {lean}`none`
when the event is refused. -/
