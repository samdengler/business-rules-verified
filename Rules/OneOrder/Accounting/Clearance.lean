# Clearances and their settlement

In Settlement with Orders the ORA sends each clearance to a Clearance Manager,
which accepts or rejects it and then settles it in clearings on remittance
dates.  The sources name the clearance statuses without a table of the moves
between them, and leave open how repeated clearances for one payment are
caught.  The model takes those answers as parameters.

/-- EARS: When the ORA sends a clearance, the system shall accept it unless it
repeats a clearance already accepted, and record only accepted clearances.

Story: As an airline, I want the Clearance Manager to accept each payment's
clearance once, so that no payment is settled twice.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-803.1: If a clearance repeats the clearance ID of one already accepted,
  then the system shall reject it.
* ONE-803.2: If a clearance not signed by both parties repeats the order ID
  and payment ID of one already accepted, then the system shall reject it.
* ONE-803.3: When the Clearance Manager accepts a clearance, the system shall
  add it to the accepted clearances and change none of the others.
* ONE-803.4: The system shall accept at most one clearance for each pair of
  order ID and payment ID.

A payment split across two payment methods has a transaction per method, each
with its own payment ID, and so two clearances.  Whether a signed clearance is
checked for a repeated order and payment is a reading of the sources
({name}`RepeatReading`).  The result is the accepted clearances afterwards, or
the reason for the rejection. -/

/-- EARS: When the ORA cancels a clearance or the Clearance Manager settles,

status and amounts as the clearance statuses describe.

Story: As an airline, I want each clearance's status to say how much of it is
settled, so that I can match every clearing to what I am owed.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-804.1: When the ORA cancels an Accepted clearance, the system shall mark
  it Cancelled and refuse every clearing for it afterwards.
* ONE-804.2: When a clearing pays all that is unsettled on a clearance, the
  system shall mark it Fully Settled if it was Accepted and Final Settlement
  otherwise.
* ONE-804.3: When a clearing pays part of what is unsettled on a clearance, the
  system shall mark it Partially Settled and settle no more than the amount
  still unsettled.
* ONE-804.4: When the Clearance Manager writes off a clearance, the system
  shall remove exactly the amount still unsettled.
* ONE-804.5: The system shall keep the amounts settled on a clearance, less
  those clawed back, plus the amount unsettled and the amount written off,
  equal to its agreed amount.

A clearing that pays nothing toward an Accepted clearance marks it Not
Settled.  Whether a clawed-back clearance can be settled again, and whether
Final Settlement can be clawed back, are a reading of the sources
({name}`SettlementReading`).  The EasyPay statuses Funds Collected and Funds
Partially Collected are not modelled.  The result is the record afterwards, or
{lean}`none` when the event is refused. -/
