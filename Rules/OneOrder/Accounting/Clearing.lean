# Net positions, clearings and short remittances

On each remittance date the Clearance Manager nets every party's clearances
into one position, pays settlement payees through clearings, and collects from
remittance payers.  When a remittance payer pays short, it splits what it
received.  The sources leave open how EasyPay clearances enter the netting,
and give two different rules for splitting a short payment, so the model takes
the answers as parameters.

/-- EARS: When the Clearance Manager nets the clearances for a remittance date,
the system shall make each party a settlement payee or a remittance payer for
its net position.

Story: As a Clearance Manager, I want each party's clearances netted into one
amount per remittance date, so that each party makes or receives one transfer
and the transfers balance.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-805.1: When the Clearance Manager nets the clearances for a remittance
  date, the system shall give each party the amounts of the clearances it is
  paid less the amounts of those it is netted as payer of.
* ONE-805.2: When a party's net position for a remittance date is positive,
  the system shall make it a settlement payee for that amount.
* ONE-805.3: When a party's net position for a remittance date is negative,
  the system shall make it a remittance payer for that amount.
* ONE-805.4: If a clearance is paid through EasyPay, then the system shall
  leave it out of the net position of its payer.
* ONE-805.5: The system shall make the net positions of all parties for a
  remittance date sum to zero.

How an EasyPay clearance enters the netting is a reading of the sources
({name}`EasyPayReading`).  The model nets one currency. -/

/-- EARS: When the Clearance Manager sends a clearing, the system shall make
its total, and the bank transfer for it, the amounts settled less the amounts
clawed back.

Story: As a settlement payee, I want each clearing's total to match the bank
transfer I receive, so that I can reconcile the transfer clearance by
clearance.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-806.1: When the Clearance Manager sends a clearing to a settlement
  payee, the system shall make its total the amounts settled for clearances
  marked Fully Settled, Partially Settled or Final Settlement, less the
  amounts clawed back.
* ONE-806.2: When the Clearance Manager sends a clearing to a remittance
  payer, the system shall list its EasyPay clearances and leave them out of
  the total.
* ONE-806.3: The system shall never make the total of a clearing to a
  settlement payee negative.

The bank transfer is the total; the model does not separate the two. -/

rule, so that I can tell which of my clearances were settled.

Acceptance criteria:

  clearance for more than the payer owes on it.
* ONE-807.2: When a remittance payer pays short, the system shall settle a
  clearance to a settlement payee only after every older clearance to that
  payee is settled in full.
* ONE-807.3: Where the Clearance Manager follows the Remittance of Funds page,
  the system shall give each settlement payee its share of the payment in
  proportion to what it is owed, rounded to a minor unit and capped at what it
  is owed.
* ONE-807.4: Where the Clearance Manager follows the Transfer of Funds page,
  the system shall apply the payment to the payer's clearances in the order
  they were recorded, whatever the payee.
* ONE-807.5: When a remittance payer pays short, the system shall allocate the
  whole payment and no more.
* ONE-807.6: If a remittance payer pays short, then the system shall settle
  each clearance for the same amount whichever source page the Clearance
  Manager follows.

The clearances are listed in the order they were recorded, oldest first.  The
page followed is a reading of the sources ({name}`AllocationReading`), and so
is the rounding of a proportional share ({name}`Rounding`).  The result lists
