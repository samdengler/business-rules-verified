# Commission and net clearance amounts

The commission an airline owes a seller on an order item, and the money that
moves between the airline that owns the order (the ORA) and the seller for
each payment.  The sources state the commission rule and show net clearance
amounts only in worked examples.  The model reads the formulas from those
examples and takes what the sources leave open as parameters.

item's commissions, each a fixed amount or a percentage of a stated base
amount.

Story: As a seller, I want every commission on an order item worked out the
same way and added up, so that I know what the airline owes me for the sale.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-801.1: Where a commission is a fixed amount, the system shall owe the
  seller that amount.
* ONE-801.2: Where a commission is a percentage of a stated base amount, the
  system shall owe the seller that share of the base to within one minor unit.
* ONE-801.3: When an order item carries several commissions in the item's
  currency, the system shall owe the seller their total.
* ONE-801.4: If the commissions on an order item are not all in the item's
  currency, then the system shall state no total.
* ONE-801.5: Where a commission is a percentage of no more than 100 percent,
  the system shall never owe more than its base amount.

The guide says several commissions apply without saying how they combine; the
model adds them.  How a percentage is rounded is a reading of the guide
({name}`Rounding`).  Whether the base is the fare alone or includes taxes, and
whether a commission subject to consumption tax is stated gross or net of that
tax, are left to the amounts the airline states.  The result is the total, or
{lean}`none` when the currencies differ. -/

Story: As a seller, I want each payment cleared with the ORA by one rule, so
that I receive my commission once and the airline receives the rest.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-802.1: When the seller collected the customer's payment and nets its
  commission, the system shall state one clearance in which the seller pays
  the ORA the payment amount less the commission.
* ONE-802.2: When the seller collected the customer's payment and its
  commission is cleared separately, the system shall state one clearance in
  which the seller pays the ORA the payment amount and one in which the ORA
  pays the seller the commission.
* ONE-802.3: When the airline collected the customer's payment, the system
  shall state one clearance in which the ORA pays the seller the commission.
* ONE-802.4: The system shall clear the seller's commission on each payment
  exactly once, leaving the ORA the payment amount less the commission and the
  seller the commission.
* ONE-802.5: When a payment is refunded through the seller, the system shall
  state one clearance in which the ORA pays the seller the refund less the
  commission recalled on it.
* ONE-802.6: If a payment is refunded through the seller, then the system
  shall not leave the seller paying the ORA for the refund.

The standard defines the net clearance amount only as what the two parties
agreed; the formulas come from the worked examples.  A refund is cleared by
{name}`refundClearance`, and how much commission it recalls is a reading of
the sources ({name}`RecallReading`). -/
