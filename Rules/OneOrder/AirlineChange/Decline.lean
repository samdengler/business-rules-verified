# Declining an airline change

A customer who does not want a change the airline made can answer it with the
Cancel or Reshop follow-up action.  The airline prices the answer as it prices
any cancellation or change, with a price differential.  The sources never say
whether the airline's cancellation and change fees apply when the customer
declines a change the airline imposed, and no source defines which changes
the airline imposes.  The model takes both answers as parameters, readings of
the sources.

/-- Which kinds of change count as involuntary: imposed by the airline, as
opposed to requested by the customer.  No source defines the two kinds, so the
model takes the answer as a parameter: a reading of the sources.  The settled
three follow from the meaning of the words: a flight the airline cancels and
flights the airline moves the customer to are involuntary, and a change the
customer made with the airline is voluntary.  The sources set no threshold for
the rest, such as a 10-minute schedule change or another operating carrier. -/

/-- Whether the airline's fees apply when a customer declines an involuntary
change.  The sources offer Cancel and Reshop as answers to a change and never
say, and the cancellation page leaves penalties to the airline.  The model
takes the answer as a parameter: a reading of the sources. -/

/-- EARS: When a customer declines an airline change through Cancel or
Reshop, the system shall price it as a cancellation or change of the affected
order items, with the airline's cancellation or change fee as the penalty.

Story: As a customer, I want to know what declining a change the airline made
will cost me, so that I can choose between the changed trip, another trip
and my money back.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-703.1: When a customer declines an airline change through Cancel or
  Auto-cancellation, the system shall price a cancellation of the affected
  order items with a new price of zero.
* ONE-703.2: When a customer declines an airline change through Reshop, the
  system shall price a change from the affected order items to the new items at
  their price.
* ONE-703.3: Where the airline waives its fees on involuntary changes, the
  system shall charge no penalty when a customer declines an involuntary change.
* ONE-703.4: If a customer declines an involuntary change through Cancel or
  Auto-cancellation, then the system shall charge no cancellation penalty.
* ONE-703.5: If a customer declines an involuntary change through Reshop, then
  the system shall charge no change fee.

The differential comes from {name}`priceDifferential`, with the reading of a
penalty above the refundable value given.  The sources do not say what
Auto-cancellation cancels and refunds; the model prices it as a Cancel of the
affected items.  Whether the fees apply is the reading's
({name}`DeclineFees`), and which changes are involuntary is another reading's
({name}`InvoluntaryReading`). -/
