# Seller follow-up actions on an airline change

When the airline changes an order, it sends the seller a change notice.  The
notice may ask the seller to act: accept the change, reshop, cancel, contact
the airline, or reprice and accept.  Each follow-up action may carry a time
limit and a consequence that applies if the seller has not acted by then.  A
notice with no follow-up action needs only acknowledgement.  The sources leave
two things open, so the model takes them as a parameter, a reading of the
sources: what applies when a time limit passes and no consequence is stated,
and whether contacting the airline, which happens outside the order, is
recorded as the seller's answer.

/-- EARS: When a time limit of a change notice passes and the seller has not

action whose time limit passed first.

Story: As a seller, I want to know what happens if I do not answer a change
notice in time, so that the customer is not surprised by an outcome nobody
chose.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-702.1: When a time limit that carries a consequence of inaction passes,
  the system shall apply the consequence of a follow-up action whose time limit
  is the earliest.
* ONE-702.2: If no follow-up action of a notice has a time limit, then the
  system shall apply no consequence of inaction.
* ONE-702.3: While no time limit of a notice has passed, the system shall
  apply no consequence of inaction.
* ONE-702.4: If the seller does not answer a change notice that carries
  follow-up actions, then the system shall resolve it before the affected
  flight departs.

A time limit passes at its instant, as an offer expires at its expiry instant.
A follow-up action with no stated consequence takes the reading's default
({name}`FollowUpReading`).  The result is the consequence that applies at the
instant given, or {lean}`none` when none applies yet. -/

/-- EARS: When an airline change notice offers follow-up actions, the system
shall keep them pending until the seller answers with one of them or a
consequence of inaction applies.

Story: As a seller, I want each change notice to show whether it waits for me,
what I answered, or what the airline did when I did not answer, so that I can
tell the customer where their trip stands.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-701.1: When an airline change notice carries no follow-up action, the
  system shall ask the seller only to acknowledge it.
* ONE-701.2: When the seller performs an offered Accept, Reshop, Cancel or
  RepriceAndAccept action before any consequence of inaction applies, the
  system shall resolve the notice with the seller's answer.
* ONE-701.3: The system shall resolve a notice with an answer only when the
  seller took that action, the notice offers it, and the seller took it before
  any consequence of inaction applied.
* ONE-701.4: While the seller has not answered a notice that offers follow-up
  actions, the system shall keep it pending until a consequence of inaction
  applies, and then resolve it with that consequence.
* ONE-701.5: When the seller contacts the airline about a notice that offers
  ContactAirline before any consequence of inaction applies, the system shall
  apply no consequence of inaction.

The seller's acts are listed in the order they happened; the first act that
answers the notice resolves it, and answering one follow-up action resolves
them all.  Whether contacting the airline counts as an answer is the reading's
({name}`FollowUpReading`). -/
