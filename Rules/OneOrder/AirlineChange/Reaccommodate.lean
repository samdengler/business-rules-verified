# Re-accommodation before the seller answers

When the airline moves a customer to other flights, it replaces the affected
order item with a new one, as a paid change does.  In the itinerary change
worked example the replacement is already in the order, at a higher order
version, while the seller's Accept is still pending, and the new services
start CONFIRMED.  The sources do not say whether a change awaiting acceptance
is provisional, so the model takes the answer as a parameter, a reading of the
sources.

/-- EARS: When the airline moves a customer to other flights, the system shall
replace the affected order item with a new item at the same price, holding a
service for each passenger on each new flight.

Story: As a customer whose flights the airline changed, I want the new flights
in my order at no extra cost and the old ones kept until I accept, so that I
can still choose what to do.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-705.1: Where an airline change takes effect when it is notified, the
  system shall replace the changed order item as a paid change does and raise
  the order version by one.
* ONE-705.2: Where an airline change waits for the seller's Accept, the system
  shall leave the order and its version unchanged when the change is notified.
* ONE-705.3: When an airline change takes effect, the system shall give the
  new order item the original item's price and a service for each passenger of
  the original item on each new flight.
* ONE-705.4: While the seller's Accept of an airline change is pending, the
  system shall keep the original order item with the status it had.
* ONE-705.5: When the airline replaces paid services at no price difference,
  the system shall mark every service of the new order item READY TO PROCEED.

The replacement is the change rule for a paid change ({name}`changeItem`):
kept services move to the new item, their originals are marked transferred,
and the other services of the original item are cancelled and removed, through
the delivery status table.  When the change takes effect is the reading's
({name}`ApplyAt`); under the reading where it waits for acceptance, applying
it once the seller accepts is the same replacement, which this rule does not
model. -/
