# A-la-carte offer items

An a-la-carte offer item is an optional ancillary with a unit price and the
passengers and segments it may be bought for.  It holds no flight.  The add bag
worked example buys one at quantity 1 for one passenger over two journeys and
gets two order items, one per journey, each at the unit price.  The model
follows the worked example: one order item for each passenger and segment
chosen, each at the unit price times the quantity.

/-- EARS: When a seller chooses an a-la-carte offer item for passengers and
segments it lists as eligible, the system shall create one order item for each
passenger and segment chosen, at the unit price times the quantity.

Story: As a seller, I want an extra bag priced the same way every time, so that
I can quote the customer the right amount before they pay.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-606.1: If an a-la-carte choice names a passenger or a segment that the
  offer item does not list as eligible, then the system shall refuse it.
* ONE-606.2: When an a-la-carte choice is accepted, the system shall create
  one order item for each passenger and segment chosen, each holding one
  service for that passenger on that segment.
* ONE-606.3: When an a-la-carte choice is accepted, the system shall price
  each order item at the unit price times the quantity.
* ONE-606.4: When an a-la-carte choice is accepted, the system shall make the
  total price of its order items the unit price times the quantity times the
  number of passengers and segments chosen.
* ONE-606.5: When an a-la-carte offer item is ordered, the system shall create
  exactly one order item from it.

The unit of the unit price is not named in the guide; the model prices per
passenger and segment, as the add bag worked example does.  The last criterion
is the rule that each offer item becomes one order item, as {name}`accept`
makes it (ONE-001.1). -/
