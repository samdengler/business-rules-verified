# Ancillaries and the flights they depend on

A bag, a seat or a meal is a service of its own in the order, for one
passenger on one flight segment, and it depends on the flight service for that
passenger and segment.  The guide records the link in two ways.  The page on
impacted dependent services shows a dependent service naming its parent
flight service by reference; the worked examples for adding an ancillary link
bags and seats to the flight only through the shared passenger and segment.
The model takes the link as a parameter, a reading of the sources.

/-- EARS: The system shall count as dependent on a flight service the
ancillary services of the order that the link between dependent and parent
ties to it.

Story: As an airline, I want to know which bags, seats and meals depend on a
flight, so that a change to the flight reaches every service it affects.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-601.1: Where the order links a dependent service to its parent by
  reference, the system shall count an ancillary service of the order as
  dependent on a flight service exactly when it names that flight service as
  its parent.
* ONE-601.2: Where the order links a dependent service to its parent through
  passenger and segment, the system shall count an ancillary service of the
  order as dependent on a flight service exactly when it is for the same
  passenger on the same segment.
* ONE-601.3: The system shall count no flight service as a dependent.
* ONE-601.4: When an order holds an ancillary service and a flight service for
  the same passenger and segment, the system shall count the ancillary service
  as dependent on that flight service.

Which link holds is the reading's ({name}`LinkReading`).  Under the reference
reading an ancillary may name another ancillary as its parent, such as a
lounge pass naming a premium seat.  The rule counts dependents of flights
only, so such a pass depends on no flight. -/
