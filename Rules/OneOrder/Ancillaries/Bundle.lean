# Removing a service from a bundle

A bundle is sold at one price.  In the seat worked example one order item at
1,000.00 EUR holds both passengers' flights and bags, and the cancellation page
removes a passenger by cancelling that passenger's services inside such an
item.  The guide prices a bundle only as a whole and does not say how much of
the price belongs to one of its services.  The model takes the share as a
parameter, a reading of the sources.

/-- How much of a bundle's price belongs to one of its services, in minor units
of the bundle's currency.  No source says, so the model takes the answer as a
parameter: a reading of the sources, such as stated component prices,
stand-alone prices, or no share at all. -/

/-- EARS: When a seller removes services from a bundle, the system shall cancel
them and return their share of the bundle price under the reading.

Story: As a customer who drops one passenger from a bundled trip, I want back
the part of the price that passenger's services were worth, so that I pay
only for what I keep.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-607.1: When services are removed from a bundle, the system shall mark
  each named live service that the delivery status table lets be removed
  CANCELLED with delivery status REMOVED and leave the bundle's other services
  and its price as they were.
* ONE-607.2: When services are removed from a bundle, the system shall return
  the sum of the shares of the services it cancels under the reading, in the
  bundle's currency.
* ONE-607.3: When services are removed from a bundle, the system shall return
  no more than the bundle price.
* ONE-607.4: When every service of a bundle is removed, the system shall
  return the whole bundle price.

A bundle here is one order item holding several services, as on the guide's
bundles page.  The share of each service is the reading's
({name}`BundleShare`).  Whether the rest of the bundle is repriced, as the
cancellation page suggests, is not modelled.  A service is removed through the
delivery status table ({name}`Delivery.endWith`), and a named service the
table does not let be removed, such as one still REQUESTED, stays as it was
and is not paid back. -/
