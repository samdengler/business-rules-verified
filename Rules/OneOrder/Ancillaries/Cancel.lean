# Cancelling a flight with its ancillaries

A seller cancels order items by naming them.  The cancellation worked example
names the flight item and the ancillary item together, and no source says
what happens to a bag or a seat when its flight is cancelled alone.  The model
takes the answer as a parameter, a reading of the sources.  An order item's
conditions may forbid cancelling it, as the extra bag of the add bag worked
example does.

/-- EARS: When a seller cancels order items, the system shall cancel every live
service of the items named and treat the services that depend on a cancelled
flight as the reading says.

Story: As a seller, I want to know what happens to a customer's bag and seat
when I cancel their flight, so that the customer neither keeps a service they
cannot use nor loses one they were promised.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-603.1: When a seller cancels order items, the system shall mark every
  live service of each named item that the delivery status table lets be
  removed CANCELLED with delivery status REMOVED.
* ONE-603.2: If a seller names an order item whose conditions do not allow
  cancellation, then the system shall refuse the request.
* ONE-603.3: When a seller cancels order items, the system shall leave as it
  was every service outside the named items that does not depend on a
  cancelled flight.
* ONE-603.4: When a seller cancels a flight, the system shall leave no live
  service that depends on it.
* ONE-603.5: The system shall never cancel a live service of an order item
  whose conditions do not allow cancellation.
* ONE-603.6: When the conditions of an order item allow cancellation, the
  system shall let the seller cancel it.

What happens to the dependents is the reading's ({name}`DependentHandling`);
which services depend on a flight is the link's ({name}`LinkReading`).  The
refund is not modelled; whose conditions govern the refund of a dependent
cancelled with its flight is an open point.  The conditions of each order item
are given by item reference.  A service is removed through the delivery status
table ({name}`Delivery.endWith`), so one still REQUESTED from the airline stays
as it was. -/
