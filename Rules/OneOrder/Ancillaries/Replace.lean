# Dependents when a flight is replaced

When a flight is replaced, by the customer's change or by the airline, the
guide asks for the effect on each dependent service to be stated, and does not
say which effect applies.  The model takes the effect for each kind of service
as a parameter, a reading of the sources: a dependent moves to the new flight,
is cancelled with its value refunded or stored, or must be reshopped.

/-- EARS: When a flight service is replaced by a flight on another segment, the
system shall state for each live service that depends on it the effect the
reading gives for its kind.

Story: As a customer whose flight changed, I want to be told what happens to my
bag and my seat, so that I know what I still hold on the new flight.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-604.1: When a flight service is replaced, the system shall state an
  effect for each live service that depends on it and for no other service.
* ONE-604.2: When a flight service is replaced, the system shall give each
  dependent service the effect the reading gives for its kind.
* ONE-604.3: Where a kind of service moves with its flight, the system shall
  put the moved service on the new segment, for the same passenger and under
  the same reference.
* ONE-604.4: When a flight service is replaced, the system shall not move a
  seat to a seat that another passenger holds on the new flight.

The effect for each kind is the reading's; which services depend on the
flight is the link's ({name}`LinkReading`).  A moved seat keeps its seat
number, since the service details are kept by reference. -/
