# Choosing seats

A seller asks for a seat map, which marks each seat of a flight available or
occupied, and chooses seats for passengers.  Each seat chosen becomes its own
order item at the seat's price, holding one seat service for the passenger on
that segment, as in the seat worked example.  The guide states no rule that a
seat goes to one passenger only, or that a passenger holds one seat per
segment; the model checks each choice against the seat map and nothing else.

/-- EARS: When a seller chooses seats for passengers, the system shall add one
order item for each seat the seat map marks available, and refuse the request
if any seat chosen is not.

Story: As a passenger, I want the seat I chose to be mine alone, so that I do
not find someone else in it.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-605.1: If a seat choice names a seat that the seat map of its segment
  does not mark available, then the system shall refuse the request.
* ONE-605.2: When a seat request is accepted, the system shall keep the
  existing order items and add one order item for each seat chosen, at the
  seat's price, holding one seat service for that passenger on that segment.
* ONE-605.3: The system shall never let two passengers hold the same seat on
  the same segment.
* ONE-605.4: The system shall let a passenger hold at most one live seat on
  each segment.

The rule records each new seat service as a seat with its number in the
service details it returns.  It checks each choice against the seat map only,
which is all the guide describes. -/
