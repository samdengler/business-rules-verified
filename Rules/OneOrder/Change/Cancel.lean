# Cancelling an order

A seller cancels an order that has no payment at once.  An order with any
payment, full or partial, is cancelled only by accepting a cancellation offer
from the airline, priced like a change whose new price is zero.

/-- EARS: When a seller asks to cancel an order, the system shall cancel it at
once if no payment has been received for it, and otherwise only through a
cancellation offer.

Story: As a seller, I want an unpaid order cancelled at once and a paid order
cancelled through an offer, so that every cancellation that returns money is
priced first.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-203.1: When a seller asks to cancel an order for which no payment has
  been received, the system shall cancel and remove at once every service of
  the order that the delivery status table lets be removed.
* ONE-203.2: When an order is cancelled at once, the system shall mark each of
  its items cancelled and the order closed.
* ONE-203.3: If a seller asks to cancel an order for which any payment has been
  received, then the system shall cancel it only through a cancellation offer.
* ONE-203.4: When an order with payments is cancelled through an offer, the
  system shall not make the amount due by the airline larger than the payments
  received for the order.
* ONE-203.5: When an order with payments is cancelled through an offer, the
  system shall price the cancellation from the order items that still hold a
  live service.

The payments received are the pilot model's payments for the order
({name}`Rules.OfferOrder.totalPaid`).  The offer is priced with
{name}`priceDifferential` from the items that still hold a live service
({name}`liveItems`): an item that a change replaced stays in the order with
its price, and counting it would return that price a second time.  A service
that the delivery status table does not let be removed, such as one still
REQUESTED or one already DELIVERED, stays as it was
({name}`Delivery.endWith`). -/
