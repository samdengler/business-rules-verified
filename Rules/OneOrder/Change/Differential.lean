# Price differentials of changes and cancellations

When a seller asks to change or cancel order items in a paid order, the airline
answers with an offer that carries a price differential: the old price, the
new price, the penalty, the forfeited amount, what the customer pays and what
the airline returns.  The ONE Order implementation guide shows these amounts
in worked examples and never states the formula that links them.  The model
reads the formula from the worked examples, states only the two non-negative
due amounts (the guide's sign for the total is inconsistent), and takes the
case the guide has no example of as a parameter.

/-- EARS: When a change or cancellation carries a penalty, the system shall
either net the penalty against the price difference or charge it separately.

Story: As a customer, I want a penalty to cost me the same whether it is
deducted from what I get back or charged on its own, so that the way the
airline collects it does not change what I pay.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-202.1: Where the penalty is netted, the system shall add the penalty
  charged to the price difference and state the result as a single amount, due
  either to or by the airline.
* ONE-202.2: Where the penalty is charged separately, the system shall add the
  penalty charged to the amount due to the airline and settle the price
  difference on its own.
* ONE-202.3: The system shall give the customer the same net amount whether the
  penalty is netted or charged separately.
* ONE-202.4: If the penalty on a cancellation is larger than the refundable
  value of the cancelled items, then the system shall not leave the customer
  owing the airline money.

The price difference is the new price, less the old price, plus the forfeited
amount.  The worked examples fit this formula, though the guide does not state
it.  The penalty charged is the whole penalty, except when the penalty is
larger than the refundable value: then it depends on the reading of the guide
({name}`ExcessPenalty`). -/

/-- EARS: When the airline prices a change or cancellation of order items, the
system shall state the amount due to the airline, the amount due by the
airline and a type code that names the outcome.

Story: As a seller, I want every change or cancellation offer to state what the
customer pays and what the airline returns, so that I can settle the change
without working the amounts out myself.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-201.1: If the prices, penalty and forfeited amount of a change are not
  all in one currency, then the system shall reject the change unpriced.
* ONE-201.2: The system shall give a price differential a type code that names
  a collection exactly when an amount is due to the airline.
* ONE-201.3: The system shall give a price differential a type code that names
  a refund or a value store exactly when an amount is due by the airline.
* ONE-201.4: When the seller asks to keep the value of cancelled items for
  later use, the system shall type the differential Reusable and set both due
  amounts to zero.
* ONE-201.5: When the airline prices a change or cancellation, the system shall
  make the amount due to the airline less the amount due by the airline equal
  the new price, less the old price, plus the penalty, plus the forfeited
  amount.

The due amounts come from {name}`dueAmounts`, except for a request to keep the
value for later use, where the guide shows both amounts as zero
