# Changing an order item

An order item is never changed in place.  A change replaces the item with a
new one: the services the change keeps move to the new item under the same
references, and their copies in the original item are marked transferred.
The other services of the original item are cancelled.  This is the change
once it is paid, as the worked examples show it after payment.

/-- EARS: When a seller has accepted and paid a change to an order item, the
system shall add a new item with the services the change keeps and cancel
the services it does not keep.

Story: As an airline, I want a changed item's kept services to move to the new
item under the same references, so that each service is delivered and
accounted for once.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-204.1: When a change keeps a service of the changed item, the system
  shall give the new item a service with the same reference, passenger,
  segment and delivery status.
* ONE-204.2: When a change keeps a service of the changed item, the system
  shall mark the original copy transferred and leave its delivery status as it
  was.
* ONE-204.3: When a change does not keep a service of the changed item, the
  system shall mark it cancelled and removed.
* ONE-204.4: When a change is made, the system shall keep the order's item
  references distinct.
* ONE-204.5: When a change is made, the system shall mark the changed item
  cancelled.

The original copy keeps its delivery status because the worked examples show
it so: after the change, the transferred copies are still READY TO PROCEED. -/
