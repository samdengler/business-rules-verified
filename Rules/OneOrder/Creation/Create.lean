# Ordering selected offer items

A seller creates an order from a selection of offer items, and one request
may select from several offers.  The selection must include every item an
offer marks mandatory; the other items are optional.  The request succeeds
as a whole or is rejected as a whole.

/-- EARS: When a seller selects items from an offer, the system shall accept
the selection only if it names items the offer holds and includes every item
the offer marks mandatory.

Story: As a seller, I want to leave out the optional items of an offer, so
that the customer pays only for what they chose.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-401.1: If a selection names an item the offer does not hold, then the
  system shall reject the selection.
* ONE-401.2: If a selection leaves out an item the offer marks mandatory, then
  the system shall reject the selection.
* ONE-401.3: When a selection is accepted, the system shall take every offer
  item it names and no other.
* ONE-401.4: When a selection is accepted, the system shall include at least
  one item the offer marks mandatory.

An item without the mandatory mark is optional.  An empty selection is not
rejected here: a request that selects nothing from any offer is rejected when
the order is created ({lit}`createOrder`), since an order holds at least one
item.  The guide also asks a selection to name the passengers each item was
built for; the model does not check that. -/

/-- What the airline does with a create request when a selection in it is
rejected.  The sources allow one request to select from several offers and do
not say, so the model takes the answer as a parameter: a reading of the
sources.  A guarantee about creation counts as proven only when it holds
under both readings. -/

/-- EARS: When a seller sends a create request with selections from one or
more offers, the system shall check each selection and create one order from
them, or reject the request.

Story: As a customer, I want a trip I chose as a whole to be ordered as a
whole, so that I never hold half of it.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-402.1: When a create request is accepted, the system shall create one
  order item for each item selected from each offer and none for the items
  left out.
* ONE-402.2: When an order is created from offers priced in one currency, the
  system shall make the order's total price the sum of the prices of the
  selected items.
* ONE-402.3: If any offer named in a create request has expired at the
  instant of the request, then the system shall reject the whole request and
  create no order.
* ONE-402.4: If a create request selects no item from any offer, then the
  system shall reject it.
* ONE-402.5: When an order is created, the system shall be able to state its
  total price in a single currency.

Each selection is checked as {name}`orderItemsFor` says.  What happens when
one is rejected depends on the reading of the sources
({name}`MultiOfferHandling`, {name}`pickItems`).  The order's total is the sum
of its item prices when they share a currency
({name}`Rules.OneOrder.Change.orderPrice`), since the guide no longer stores a
total on the order. -/
