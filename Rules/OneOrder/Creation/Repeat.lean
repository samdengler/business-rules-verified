# Repeated create requests

A seller whose create request times out may send it again.  The sources do
not say whether creating an order uses up its offers, or how the airline
recognizes a repeated request.  The model recognizes one by the offers it
names, and takes what the airline does with it as a parameter: a reading of
the guide.

/-- What the airline does with a create request that names an offer which has
already produced an order.  The sources are silent, so the model takes the
answer as a parameter.  A guarantee about repeated requests counts as proven
only when it holds under every reading. -/

/-- EARS: When a seller sends a create request, the system shall create the
order and record the offers it came from, unless an offer it names has
already produced an order.

Story: As a seller, I want a request I send again after a timeout to give me
the order I already have, so that the customer is not booked twice.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-403.1: When a create request that names no offer with an order is
  accepted, the system shall record the new order against every offer it
  names.
* ONE-403.2: Where the airline returns the existing order for a repeated
  request, the system shall answer a request that names an offer which
  already produced an order with a recorded order from one of its offers, and
  record no new order.
* ONE-403.3: Where the airline rejects repeated requests, the system shall
  reject a request that names an offer which already produced an order.
* ONE-403.4: The system shall create at most one order from each offer.

A request that names an offer with an order is handled as the reading of the
guide says ({name}`RepeatHandling`).  When it names offers from more than one
recorded order, the first recorded order is the existing one. -/
