# Order versions and history

An order starts at version 1, and each group of changes the airline applies
raises its version by one.  The order's history is the order at version 1
followed by the change groups, from which a seller can rebuild each version.
A seller may send the version it saw with a change, so the airline can tell
whether the change was made on data that still holds.

/-- EARS: When the airline applies a group of changes to an order, the system
shall raise the order's version by one and record the group in the order's
history.

Story: As a seller, I want each version of an order to stand for one set of
changes, so that I can rebuild any version from the order's history.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-404.1: When an order is created, the system shall give it version 1 and
  a history with no change groups.
* ONE-404.2: When the airline applies a group of changes to an order, the
  system shall apply the group to the order and raise its version by one.
* ONE-404.3: The system shall keep an order's version one more than the number
  of change groups applied since it was created.
* ONE-404.4: When a seller asks for an order's history, the system shall
  return the order at version 1 and each later change group once, labelled
  with the version it produced.
* ONE-404.5: When a seller applies the change groups of an order's history to
  the order at version 1 in the order listed, the system shall give the order
  as it is now.

The history is listed oldest first or newest first, as the reading of the
sources says ({name}`HistoryListing`, {name}`orderHistory`). -/

inductive VersionRejection

  deriving DecidableEq, Repr, Inhabited

/-- EARS: When a seller sends a change request, the system shall compare the
order version the request carries, if any, with the order's current version
before applying the change.

Story: As a seller, I want a change I make on an order I saw at an older
version to be refused, so that I never overwrite a change I have not seen.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-405.1: When a change request carries the order's current version, the
  system shall apply the change and raise the version by one.
* ONE-405.2: When a change request carries no version, the system shall apply
  the change.
* ONE-405.3: If a change request carries a version other than the order's
  current version, then the system shall reject the change.

A request without a version proceeds, as the guide says.  A request with
another version is handled as the reading of the guide says
({name}`StaleHandling`). -/
