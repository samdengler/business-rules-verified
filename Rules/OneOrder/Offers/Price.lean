# Prices from their parts

A price in an offer is stated with its parts: an amount before discounts and
the discount, surcharges, fees, a tax summary, and consumption taxes such as
VAT or HST.  The guide names the parts and shows examples, and states no
formula.  The model adds the parts up, and takes as a parameter the one choice
the examples leave open: whether the consumption tax not included in the price
comes from the tax lines or from the stated total of excluded tax.

/-- EARS: When an airline states a price with its parts, the system shall total
the price as its base amount plus its surcharges, fees, taxes and the
consumption tax not included in it.

Story: As a seller, I want every price to add up from its parts, so that the
total I show the customer is the total the airline charges.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-506.1: If the amounts of a price are not all in one currency, then the
  system shall reject the price.
* ONE-506.2: If a price's discount is larger than its amount before discounts,
  then the system shall reject the price.
* ONE-506.3: The system shall state a price's base amount as its amount before
  discounts less its discount.
* ONE-506.4: The system shall make a tax summary's total the sum of its
  entries.
* ONE-506.5: The system shall make a price's total its base amount plus its
  surcharges, its fees, its tax summary total and the consumption tax not
  included in it.
* ONE-506.6: When a consumption tax line is marked as not included in the
  price, the system shall add its tax to the price's total.

Where the consumption tax not included comes from is a reading of the guide
