# Change and cancel restrictions

An offer item carries rules for voluntary changes and cancellations.  Each rule
belongs to one stage of the journey (before payment, before departure, after
departure, no show) and starts at its effective date.  At an instant, the rule
in force is the latest one of the current stage that has started.  It decides
whether a change is allowed and for what fee, and what a cancellation returns.
The guide leaves two points open, so the model takes them as parameters:
whether a rule's expiration date ends it, and which amount a refund marked full
and also given a fixed amount returns.

/-- EARS: When a change or cancellation is asked for at an instant, the system

Story: As a seller, I want to know which change or cancel rule applies at any
moment of the journey, so that I can tell the customer what a change costs and
what a cancellation returns.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-503.1: When a rule is in force for an action at an instant, the system
  shall take it from the rules for that action and for the stage the journey is
  in at that instant.
* ONE-503.2: When a rule is in force at an instant, the system shall take one
  whose effective date is not after that instant.
* ONE-503.3: When rules for an action and the current stage have started, and
  have not expired where expiration dates end rules, the system shall take as
  the rule in force one with the latest effective date among them.
* ONE-503.4: Where expiration dates end rules, the system shall not take a rule
  as in force at or after its expiration date.
* ONE-503.5: While a journey is in a stage for which an action has rules, the
  system shall have a rule in force for that action.

Whether a rule's expiration date ends it is a reading of the guide
({name}`ExpiryReading`). -/

/-- EARS: When a customer asks for a voluntary change, the system shall refuse
it if the rule in force forbids it, and otherwise quote it with the rule's fee
as the penalty.

Story: As a customer, I want a change to cost what the rule in force says, so
that I pay the fee and the fare difference and nothing else.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-504.1: If the rule in force forbids a change of the kind asked for, then
  the system shall refuse the change.
* ONE-504.2: When the rule in force allows a change and states a fee, the
  system shall quote the change with that fee as its penalty.
* ONE-504.3: When the rule in force allows a change and states no fee, the
  system shall quote the change with no penalty.
* ONE-504.4: When the rule in force allows a change with a fee no larger than
  the price of the items changed, and the seller does not ask to keep the value
  for later use, the system shall price the change so that the customer owes
  the fee plus the fare difference, net of what the airline returns.

The quote is a change for ONE-201 to price ({name}`Change.priceDifferential`):
the old and new prices, the fee as the penalty, and nothing forfeited.  When no rule is in force the decision says
so; the guide does not say what applies then. -/

promised, so that I know what I get back before I cancel.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-505.1: If the cancel rule in force forbids cancellation, then the system

  refund and no fixed amount, the system shall return the item's whole price.
* ONE-505.3: When the cancel rule in force allows cancellation with a fixed
  refund not marked full, the system shall return that amount.
* ONE-505.4: When the cancel rule in force allows cancellation and sends the
  refund to the original form of payment, the system shall pay the refund to
  the original form of payment.

  return at least the taxes, fees and charges in its price that are flagged
  refundable.
