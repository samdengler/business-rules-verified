# Time limits on offers and new order items

An offer expires at an instant, and each offer item may carry time limits of
its own: a price guarantee, an inventory guarantee and a payment time limit.
Before an order exists, no limit outlasts the offer.  When an order is
created, each order item takes its payment time limit and its price guarantee
from its offer item.  The guide leaves three points open, so the model takes
them as parameters: whether a guarantee still holds at the instant it ends,
what happens when an offer is accepted after a price guarantee has lapsed, and
which form of payment time limit applies when an offer item states two.

/-- EARS: While no order has been created from an offer, the system shall treat
an offer item's price and inventory as guaranteed only until both the item's
guarantee time limit and the offer's expiry.

Story: As an airline, I want an offer's guarantees to end when the offer
expires, so that I never stand behind a price or a seat for an offer that can
no longer be accepted.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-501.1: If an offer item carries no price guarantee time limit, then the
  system shall treat its price as not guaranteed.
* ONE-501.2: While an instant is before an offer item's price guarantee time
  limit and before the offer's expiry, the system shall treat the item's price
  as guaranteed.
* ONE-501.3: While an instant is before an offer item's inventory guarantee
  time limit and before the offer's expiry, the system shall treat the item's
  inventory as guaranteed.
* ONE-501.4: The system shall end every price and inventory guarantee of an
  offer no later than the offer's expiry.
* ONE-501.5: The system shall not treat an offer item's price as guaranteed at
  an instant at which the offer can no longer be accepted.

A guarantee runs until the earlier of its own limit and the offer's expiry.
Whether it still holds at that instant is a reading of the guide
({name}`GuaranteeEnd`).  The offer's expiry on its own guarantees nothing. -/

Story: As an airline, I want each new order item to start with the payment
time limit and price guarantee its offer item promised, so that the customer
gets the time to pay and the price the offer stated.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-502.1: When an order is created from an offer item whose payment time
  limit is stated only as a duration, the system shall set the order item's
  payment time limit to the creation instant plus that duration.
* ONE-502.2: When an order is created from an offer item whose payment time
  limit is stated only as a fixed date and time, the system shall set the
  order item's payment time limit to that instant.
* ONE-502.3: When an order is created, the system shall carry each offer
  item's price guarantee time limit into its order item.
* ONE-502.4: If a customer accepts an offer after the price guarantee of one of
  its items has lapsed, then the system shall not create the order at the
  offered price.
* ONE-502.5: When an order is created, the system shall give no order item a
  payment time limit before the order's creation.
* ONE-502.6: When an offer item's payment time limit is a duration of zero, the
  system shall accept a payment for its order item made at the instant the
  order is created.

The checks of ONE-001 run first ({name}`accept`).  Then, under the reading that
asks for a new offer, an item whose price guarantee has lapsed refuses the
acceptance.  Which payment time limit applies when an offer item states both
