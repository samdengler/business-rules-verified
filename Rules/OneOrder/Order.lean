# Order items and orders

Order items hold services and carry the price; an order holds order items.
The statuses of items and orders follow from their services, as the ONE Order
implementation guide defines them.

Story: As a revenue accountant, I want each order item's status worked out from
its services, so that I know which items still hold value.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-002.1: While at least one service of an order item holds value, the system
  shall mark the item active.
* ONE-002.2: When every service of an order item is cancelled or transferred and
  none holds value, the system shall mark the item cancelled.
* ONE-002.3: When at least one service of an order item is delivered and every
  other service is delivered or removed, the system shall mark the item closed.
* ONE-002.4: The system shall give each order item exactly one status.

The result lists every status whose condition holds, so an item that meets two
conditions, or none, shows it. -/

/-- EARS: The system shall mark an order opened while any of its services holds
value, and closed once all its items are closed or cancelled and all its
services are delivered or removed.

Story: As an airline, I want an order's status worked out from its items and
services, so that an order is closed only when nothing in it holds value.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-003.1: While at least one service of an order holds value, the system
  shall mark the order opened.
* ONE-003.2: When every item of an order is closed or cancelled and every
  service is delivered or removed, the system shall mark the order closed.
* ONE-003.3: The system shall never mark an order both opened and closed.
* ONE-003.4: The system shall give every order that has a service either the
  status opened or the status closed.

The result lists every status whose condition holds. -/
