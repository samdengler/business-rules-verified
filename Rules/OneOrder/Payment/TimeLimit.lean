# Payment time limits

An order item waiting for payment carries a payment time limit.  When the
limit passes and no successful payment covers the item, the item is removed
and any payment still pending for it fails.

/-- What happens to an order item's services when its payment time limit
passes unpaid.  The guide says the item is removed and names no statuses.
Removing an item cancels its services, so each service the delivery status
table lets end takes the service status CANCELLED.  The delivery status it
ends in is a reading of the guide: REMOVED, REMOVED HOLD VALUE or EXPIRED,
each reached through the delivery status table. -/
structure Removal where
  /-- The event that ends each service of the removed item. -/
  event : Delivery.DeliveryEvent
  /-- The event is a cancellation, with or without the value held, or the end
  of the time to claim the service. -/
  ends : event = .remove ∨ event = .removeHoldValue ∨ event = .expire

/-- Whether an order item's payment time limit has passed at an instant with
no SUCCESSFUL payment covering it. -/
def PayableOrder.lapses (o : PayableOrder) (now : Instant) (pi : PayableItem) : Bool :=
  pi.timeLimit.any (· ≤ now) && !isPaid o.payments pi.item.id

/-- An order item removed: every service is cancelled and ends by the
removal's event, where the delivery status table lets it. -/
def PayableItem.remove (m : MoveReading) (r : Removal) (pi : PayableItem) : PayableItem :=
  { pi with item := { pi.item with services := pi.item.services.map (endWith m r.event .cancelled) } }

/-- A payment with the transaction of every PENDING method marked FAILED. -/
def Transaction.failPending (p : Transaction) : Transaction :=
  { p with parts := p.parts.map fun m =>
      if m.status = .pending then { m with status := .failed } else m }

/-- EARS: When an order item's payment time limit passes with no SUCCESSFUL
payment covering it, the system shall remove the item and mark FAILED every
PENDING payment that covers it.

Story: As an airline, I want unpaid order items removed when their payment
time limit passes, so that seats and services are not held for customers who
do not pay.

Acceptance criteria:

* ONE-306.1: When an order item's payment time limit has passed and no
  SUCCESSFUL payment covers it, the system shall remove the item, cancelling
  every service of it that the delivery status table lets end, so that none of
  those services is live afterwards.
* ONE-306.2: When an order item is removed at its payment time limit, the
  system shall mark FAILED every PENDING payment that covers it.
* ONE-306.3: If a SUCCESSFUL payment covers an order item, then the system
  shall not remove the item at a payment time limit.
* ONE-306.4: While an order item's payment time limit has not passed, the
  system shall leave the item unchanged.
* ONE-306.5: The system shall not keep an unpaid order item in the order
  indefinitely.
* ONE-306.6: When an order item is removed at its payment time limit, the
  system shall leave none of its services holding value.

A time limit passes at its instant, as an offer expires at its expiry instant.
Which delivery status a removed item's services end in is a reading of the
guide (see {name}`Removal`), and each service gets there through the delivery
status table ({name}`Delivery.endWith`). -/
