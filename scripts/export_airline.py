"""Write build/airline-data/model.json and theorems.json, the parts of the
model that Verified Airline's site reads, served at /airline-data/ beside
facts.json.

Verified Airline is a fictional airline whose site has its own repository,
https://github.com/samdengler/verified-airline.  Its build reads three files
from here: facts.json, Verified Airline's fares in Airline/Fares.lean evaluated
by the model's functions (lake exe airline-facts); model.json, which this
script writes from build/status.json and the review document's
cross-references:

  * every requirement, with its EARS statement in Kiro's notation, its Lean
    name, the address of its chapter, and its criteria with their statuses;
  * for each criterion an open theorem checks, those theorems, each with the
    start of its question and the address of its section;
  * the commit the files were built from;

and theorems.json, which this script writes from build/airline-theorems.json
(lake exe airline-facts --theorems): for each fact about a change or a
cancellation, keyed by its place in facts.json, the theorem in
Airline/Theorems.lean that states it for every input in its stage, with its
docstring, its rule, and its line on GitHub at the same commit.

Addresses are absolute, on this site, since the airline's pages are served
from another.
